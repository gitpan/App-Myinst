App-Myinst - Implements very limited features of a legendary command-line tool at an iconic internet company.

The user of this module is expected to create a small driver script like this:

    $ vi myinst.pl
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use App::Myinst;

    App::Myinst->run();
    
and run with options.

Usage: ./myinst.pl <command> -h host1,host2 -j 4 "<remote_command>"
Implements very limited features of a legendary command-line tool at an iconic internet company.

    <command>           command to myinst.  currently, only "ssh" is supported
    -h                  hostname, can be a comma-separated list
    -H                  specify a file with hostnames in it
    -j                  number of jobs to execute in parallel.  default: 1
    -f                  flag to save output in a file per host.  default: cwd
    -dir                if -f is specified, you may specify the output directory
    -d                  debug mode
    <remote_command>    the command to run on the remote hosts
    
Note on testing:
This module wraps around ssh and as such, requires authentication.
I have included an interactive test_deeply.pl script for those interested in testing.
